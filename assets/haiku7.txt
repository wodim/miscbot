the half-life of lime
jello nuclear bedtime story
crazy customizable
programmer's head on a stick
frictionless, massless mormon
put it in your report, bill
i don't need the influence
i'm coming out of the booth
in the middle of a storm
it tantalizes me so
you are my favorite thing
i leave the windows open
and fed you to the chickens
candy corn chicken fetus
the silhouette of a dog
guns exploding all around
a rising column of smoke
you don't jump like a monkey
